# Instructions for Running the Project

The project has a few dependencies (to be expected as it is a Python project).

To install them, the following should suffice:
1. Install Python from [the Python Foundation](https://python.org)/
2. Install PyGame using `pip`. On Windows: `py -3 -m pip install pygame`. On Mac: `pip install pygame`. On Linux `pip3 install pygame`

From there, run the following command from the `FA24-Group25` directory:
```bash
python3 Project/main.py
```
